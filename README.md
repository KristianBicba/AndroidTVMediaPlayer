# Look, but don't touch

Right now, the repository just includes an Android app and a Kotlin library.
It's nowhere near functional, but both modules contain some code which may be
useful as a reference.

I'll set up and commit the actual modules (lib_fileserver, lib_communications,
app_phone, app_tv) later. For now, just use this project to get familiar with
the build.
