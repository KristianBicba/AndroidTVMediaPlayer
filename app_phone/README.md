# Media player remote control

This module acts as a remote control for the TV app. You can add remote fileservers (as long as said fileservers are 
SFTP fileservers) and pair a TV (or TVs), then connect to it and control playback.

If you're both applications in the emulator, please see the README.md for `/app_tv/`. As long as you connect TCP 
port 34124, they should be able to pair and communicate without a problem.
